2003-06-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: [Bugzilla 25528].
	  8.4 spinbox - Added missing aliases (-bd, -bg, -fg).
	  8.4 panedwindow - Added missing aliases (-bd, -bg).
	  8.4 entry - Added missing option (-readonlybackground, -disabledbackground, -disabledforeground)
	  8.4 entry - Added missing new -state 'readonly'.
	  8.3 label - Added missing options (-disabledforeground).

2002-07-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* All changes below belong to the fix for Bugzilla 19847. Instead
	  of using a complex signaling mechanism to tell if a variable,
	  provided via its name, is written by a command we use three
	  checker commands, one knowing that the variable is only read
	  (original command), a second one knowing that the variable is
	  written, and the last one knowing that the variable is not
	  touched at all, just declared. All commands checking a variable
	  name were looked at and updated to use the correct variant of
	  the checker command.

	* xmlGen.pcx:
	* tclX.tcl: 
	* tclDomPro.pcx: 
	* tclCom.pcx: 
	* sybtcl.pcx:
	* incrTcl.tcl: 
	* coreTk.tcl: 
	* coreTcl.tcl:
	* blt.tcl: Changed some appearances of 'checkVarName' to
	  'checkVarNameWrite', for the commands who do write variables.

	* analyzer.tcl: Reverted 'checkVarName' to 'read' mode and
	  introduced 'checkVarNameWrite'. The latter assumes that the
	  variable is written.

2002-06-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* coreTcl.tcl (trace, 8.4): Subcommand 'list' is 'info'. See TIP
	  #102.

	* coreTcl.tcl (file, 8.4): New subcommand 'link'. See TIP #99.

	* coreTk.tcl (tk, 8.4): New subcommand 'caret'. See TIP #96.

	* coreTk.tcl (wm, 8.4): New subcommand 'attributes'. See TIP #95.

	* coreTk.tcl (listbox, 8.4): Added option -activestyle, see TIP
	  #94.

	* Update to TIP #93 not possible, subcommands of widgets not
	  checkable (right now). (Needs more type inference to know the
	  type of a fixed word or of the content of a variable.

	* analyzer.tcl: Added -offrelief to the list of standard
	  options. See TIP #82.

	* coreTk.tcl (checkbutton, radiobutton, 8.4): Added option
	  -offrelief. See TIP #82.

2002-06-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Added declarations which warn that 'labelframe',
	  'panedwindow' and 'spinbox' are reserved in Tk 8.4. Bugzilla
	  entry 19507.

2002-06-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* analyzer.tcl: tcl_platform is portable, just usage implies
	  no-portable code. Removed the warning in 'analyzer::checkVariable'.

2002-05-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Added code to [checkBindBody] so that it:
	
	  - checks validity of %-placeholders.

	  - deals with the %-placeholders in such a way that the existing
	    checkers can check a bind-script containing them without
	    change. This is done by replacing them with either a lone %
	    (%%) or a variable (%A -> $A, etc.). Additional code in
	    analyzer.tcl ensures that the error messages still report the
	    unmangled code (if there are warnings and errors).

	* coreTcl.tcl: Extended [fconfigure] with recognition of read-only
	  option "-error" from version 8.0 and above.

	* coreTcl.tcl (checkBinaryFmt): Extended to accept an empty string
	  of specifiers.

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed definition of listbox. The option is
	  -listvariable, not -listvar.

	* coreTcl.tcl: Added missing [string is] keywords: control, graph,
	  print, punct, and xdigit.

2002-05-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* coreTcl.tcl (checkFormatFmt, checkScanFmt): Better handling of
	  %% in [format], and added handling of %% to [scan].

	* coreTcl (trace (4.1)): Allowing abbreviations for subcommands.

	* coreTk: grid rowconfigure -minsize. Switched to
	  [checkPixels]. The command allows screen units, not only
	  integers.

	* coreTk.tcl (checkSticky): Checker has to accept the empty
	  string. Changed message for "coreTk::badSticky" too, to reflect
	  that an empty string is allowed.

	* coreTk.tcl (place window): Accept abbreviations for -anchor. Did
	  so for [place configure window], but not for the [place window]
	  syntax. Fixed.

	* coreTk.tcl (grid slaves): Accepts both -row and -column
	  simultaneously.

2002-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* blt.tcl: Changed 'checkSwitches2' to 'checkSwitches'. The former
	  checker does not exist.

	* coreTk.tcl: Changed the code dealing with the move of
	  "tk[A-Z].*" functions to the tk namespace. Added functions I
	  missed because they are part of bindings and thus not autoloaded
	  during startup. Added code to make the mapping between old and
	  new names more automtic, added code for the complicated cases of
	  mapping.

	* coreTcl.tcl: Fixed 8.4 definition of [array names] checker.

	* analyzer.tcl (checkOption): Calls default checker if present and
	  first word is not a literal.

2002-04-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Completed an update to handle 8.3.1 to 8.3.4, and 8.4. Added a
	  number of additional checks which were not done before. For now
	  see file 'Udates' for a complete list of the changes.

	* checkerCmdline.tcl:
	Fixed usage string.

2001-3-13 Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com>

	* configure.tcl:
	Switched order of .pcx file loading so that built-ins come
	first and user-supplied ones come later.  (For Synopsis)

2001-2-26 Brent Welch <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	Turned off use of the .tbc files

2001-2-8 Brent Welch <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	Fix the bad auto_load entry for Tcl7.3.

2000-10-09  Sven Delmas  <sven@scriptics.com>

	* tests/checker.test: Fixed the test suite to handle the changed
	error string result (I removed the line number from the returned
	string). 

2000-09-07  Sven Delmas  <sven@scriptics.com>

	* message.tcl: Removed the leading line number in the returned
	error messages as requested by bug # 5670.

2000-08-28  Brent Welch	 <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* checkerCmdline.tcl: Made sure the license is released in error cases.

	* checkerCmdline.tcl: fixed to always check license.

2000-06-13  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug 5466 by adding a procedure
	CheckExtraCloseChar to check for trailing \}'s as well as \]'s in
	all words.

	* coreTcl.tcl: fixed bug 5737 by making the scan command only have
	2 required args.  Fixed bug 3976 by making return -errorCode take
	any argument.

	* coreTcl.tk: fixed bug 5332 by allowing "" as well as program and
	user (and their abbreviations) as arguments for "wm sizefrom".

2000-05-09  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

	* tclDomPro.pcx: fixed bug 4772 by updating the TclDomPro checker
	table to match its changes.

2000-03-23  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

2000-02-09  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl: changed return value for checkProcCall--in the
	case where implicit args were added to the procedure call, the
	wrong index was returned. (RFE 883)

1999-12-09  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

	* xmlGen.pcx (checker): updated xmlgen table to add new -pretty
	option to the startDocument proc.

	* checker.tcl
	* checkerCmdline.tcl
	* configure.tcl
	* coreTcl.tcl: modified startup code to gracefully merge pcx with
	built-in extensions.  Updated previously existing command-line arg
	tests.

1999-11-23  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@nutella.scriptics.com>

	from message::displayTTY to message::collectMsg.

1999-11-12  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTcl.tcl: fixed bug 3594 by adding a coreTcl::checkUplevelCmd
	proc--now the uplevel script gets checked if it is 1 literal
	argument (same support as the eval command).

1999-11-01  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* tclCom.pcx (checker): updated foreachitem table entry to accept
	either 3 or 4 arguments, where the last args is always a script.

	* analyzer.tcl: 
	added a "checkTailArgsFirst" procedure to check commands with a
	fixed number of tail args and a variable number of head args.  The
	existing "checkTailArgs" procedure only applies when checking
	preceeding switches.

1999-10-28  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug 2230 by adding a state var that
	disallows multiple nonDefAfterDef and argAfterArgs errors in the
	same arg list.

1999-10-26  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in
	* configure.tcl: removed scwizards package from checker--wizard
	code is not getting checked.

1999-10-25  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* scwizards.pcx (checker): removed calculateLocation and
	emitCheckerCode from the table--they are nolonger defined.  Added
	checkPattern and modified addMenu procs per API change.

	* blend.pcx
	* scwizards.pcx
	* tclCom.pcx
	* tclDomPro.pcx
	* xmlGen.pcx: added <nmspc>::<proc> elements to the scan commands
	list so that the bodies of control structures will be checked for
	fully qualified proc calls. (bug 2585)

	* analyzer.tcl: changed a regexp to properly strip leading "::"s
	off a fully qualified proc name (when looking for proc bodies to
	scan).  (bug 2585)

1999-10-22  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed bug 377 by using checkOption instead of
	checkSwitches for the -display option to the "winfo interps"
	command.

	* incrTcl.tcl: New checkFindObjs proc was added to fix bug 2510.
	Incr Tcl find command nolonger gives errors with nonliteral options.  

	* tclCom.pcx (checker): added tclcom::configure command to checker
	table.

1999-10-19  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

1999-10-15  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl: Fixed checkProcCall to append the correct number
	of implicit args to the procedure call--nolonger gives spurious
	warnings.  (RFE 883)

1999-10-11  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.tcl:
	* xmlServer.pcx: Fixed bug 3041 by adding code to check the xmld
	extension.

1999-09-03  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* coreTcl.tcl: Fixed lindex, linsert, lrange, and lreplace so they
	use checkIndexExpr for 8.1 and later versions. [Bug: 2692]

1999-08-19  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* tclCom.pcx: added Cehcker support for TclCom.

	* message.tcl
	* analyzer.tcl: added new message ID:  numListElts to flag errors
	where a proc was called with a list containing the wrong number of
	elements.

	* configure.tcl: added code to source wrapped pcx files.

1999-08-06  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* blend.pcx: added Checker support for Tcl Blend.
	* oratcl.pcx: added Checker support for OraTcl.

1999-08-03  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl
	* coreTcl.tcl: improved fix for bug 743 by changing
	analyzer::checkForeachCmd to check for varRef warning in lists of
	variable names.

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug 2231 by adding a check for reference
	vars (list elements beginning with a '$') in proc's arg list.

	* coreTcl.tcl: fixed bug 743 by changing coreTcl::checkForeachCmd
	to check for a variable name in all odd args except the last arg.

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug 2485 by changing analyzer::checkVarName
	to complain if the 1st elt of 1st elt of subtokens is "variable"
	regardless of the size of the subtoken list.

1999-08-01  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* configure.tcl: fixed bug that caused the -W1 and -W2 flags to be
	ignored.

1999-07-29  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* blt.tcl:
	* configure.tcl:
	* coreTcl.tcl:
	* coreTk.tcl:
	* expect.tcl:
	* incrTcl.tcl:
	* tclX.tcl: fixed bug that caused check to crash when built in
	procs are redefined.  The fix was to use the fully qualified
	procedure name ::analyzer::warn instead of "warn".

1999-07-27  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug that caused checker not to read from
	stdin if -onepass flag is used.

	* message.tcl: added new message ID "obsoleteCmd".

	* expect.tcl: upgraded to work with Expect 5.31.  exp_interact
	called with -eof, -timeout, or -timestamp give obsoleteCmd error.
	expect (and other similar commands) called with -timestamp or
	-iwrite give a "use -gl" warning and the flags are interpreted as
	pattern arguments, as of Expect 5.31.  exp_interpreter can be
	called with the "-eof script" option as of Expect 5.31.

	* coreTcl.tcl: added checking support for debugger_break and new
	options for debugger_eval.

	* coreTk.tcl: tkerror command gives the obsoleteCmd error as of
	Tk8.0.

1999-07-26  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* configure.tcl: fixed crashing checker bug when run with -use
	Tcl7.3 -use TclX.  Now the check catches the error and prints a
	message telling the user there is not compatible TclX version for
	Tcl7.3.

1999-07-22  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* configure.tcl: added -pcx command line option (rfe 2238)

1999-06-25  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl:
	* coreTcl.tcl: added tcl8.1 and tk8.1 tables.  The "regsub"
	command is the only one that changed.

	* tclX.tcl: added missing "have_symlink" option to table entry for
	"infox" tclX command.

1999-06-23  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* expect.tcl: Fixed bug 2118.  Changed exp_sleep table entry to
	check argument with checkFloat rather than checkInt.  Added
	"break" in option parsing loop when "--" is encountered in the
	exp_send command.  Fixed un-logged bug that caused the argument
	of the -brace option to be re-checked.  

1999-06-22  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl:
	* message.tcl: Fixed bug 1314 by adding new message id
	"warnUndefProc".  In addition to listing the undefined procedures
	at the end if -verbose is specified, now the warning is triggered
	for the first use of the undefined proc on the line where it occurs
	regardless of the -verbose flag.

	* tclX.tcl: Fixed bug 984 by adding have_signal_restart and
	have_fchown options to TclX table entry for the infox command.
	Fixed bug 1124 by removing the "warn nonPortCmd" call from the
	TclX table entry for the dup command.

1999-06-21  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed bug 459.  Changed table entry for the "event
	generate" command--now calls checkWidgetOptions instead of
	checkSwitches.  Removed the checkEventGenerate command, as it is
	nolonger called.

1999-06-18  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed bugs 522 and 1140.  Changed Tk table entries
	for tk_bindForTraversal and tk_menuBar to give warnUnsupported
	message with instruction to the the "menu" command instead.
	Replaced default "checkBody" call for "scale -command" with
	"checkWord" because the scale command appends args the -command's
	argument.

1999-06-17  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* tclX.tcl: Fixed bug 1749.  Changed tclX::checkLIndex to allow
	indices "len-<integer>" and "end-<integer>".

	* coreTcl.tcl: added new 8.1 switches for regexp and regsub.

1999-06-16  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTcl.tcl: Fixed bug 2134:  checker did not accept new
	startIndex aruments for the string first and string last
	commands.  Also added checking for the new -nocase option to the
	string match command.

1999-05-06    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: 
	* coreTcl.tcl: 
	* configure.tcl: Added 8.1 support (string and encoding).

	* analyzer.tcl: Added analyzer::checkIndexExpr

1999-02-20    <surles@YODA>

	* context.tcl: The context::head API was always returning :: even
	if the original context was not a fully qualified path.  The fix
	was to return :: only if the context is fully qualified, otherwise
	return an empty  string. [Bug: 983]

	* userproc.tcl:  uproc::isRedefined tries to determine how
	the user proc was redefined.  Two procs w/ the same name, two
	classes w/ the same name, a proc and a class w/ the same name,
	etc.  The bug was that it would skip the first user proc with an
	identical signature, hoping to find a better message by looking at
	the next user proc on the list.  In the example above, the
	signatures are identical, so only one user proc was defined.  The
	skip happened, but there were no more user procs on the list.
	Thus the error was never logged.  The fix was to skip only if the
	signature were identical, a skip had not already been found, AND
	to see if there are more user procs on the list. [Bug: 1038]

1999-02-19    <surles@YODA>

	* configure.tcl: Fixed bug where the -verbose flag was reporting
	the wrong version of expect.

	* incrTcl.tcl: Fixed bug where the itcl:: aliases were only being
	made for version 3.0+ but should be done for 2.0+.

1999-02-17    <surles@YODA>

	* incrTcl.tcl: Added checkers for itcl::* commands so they are
	aliased to the corresponding commands. [Bug: 1214]


1999-01-20    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed so unknown keysyms are always reported as
	nonportable instead of as bad events. [Bug: 267]

1999-01-08    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* expect.tcl: Added checkers for non exp* commands so they are
	lower priority than other extensions' checkers [Bug: 980]

1998-12-29    <surles@YODA>

	* analyzer.tcl: Moved generic widget checker from coreTk to
	analyzer.  Added new API to register generic widget configuration
	options.  Added a checkSwitches2 API that is identical to the 
	original checkSwitches, accept that it does not log errors if
	there are remaining args.  This is used in conjunction with the
	new checkTailArgs checker, that fixes the problems with checking
	lsort, lsearch, etc.

1999-01-06    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* coreTcl.tcl: Changed SCCS string to RCS string.

	* analyzer.tcl: Fixed minor typos and removed an overly
	complicated regular expression.

1998-12-01    <surles@YODA>

	* coreTk.tcl: The bind command was checking for events not event
	sequences. [#886:bug fix]

1998-11-18    <surles@YODA>

	* analyzer.tcl: Merged the scan and checker tables so data is not
	repeated in the two tables.  The scan table now has a flag that
	indicates that a command should be scanned, then the checker in
	the checker table is used to scan the command.  [#837:bug fix]

1998-11-16    <surles@YODA>

	* tclX.tcl: Filled in tables of TclX commands to be scanned and
	checked. [#828:new feature]

	* message.tcl: Added new message IDs: badByteNum and
	mismatchedOptions [new feature]

	* expect.tcl: Added comands that need to be scanned when checking
	Expect bodies. [#829: bug fix]

	* analyzer.tcl: (analyzer::checkByteNum) Added checker that
	verifies the word is an integer between 0 and 255.  This is used
	by TclX, but I thought it was generic enough. [#828:new checker]
