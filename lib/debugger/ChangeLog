	  new Cygwin drive specification syntax when running on Windows.
	  (Was //d/foo -> D:/foo   Now also /cygdrive/d/foo -> D:/foo)

2001-2-26 Brent Welch <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	Turned off use of the .tbc files

2001-2-8 Brent Welch <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

        * debugger.tcl.in: Made printing the Copyright not the default.
	Replaced -nologo cmd line arg with -logo.

2000-10-10  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* nub.tcl: Fixed so auto_import'ed code is only instrumented if
	the autoLoad flag is set.  [Bug: 5038]

2000-10-06  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/nub.test: 
	* nub.tcl: Fixed rename checking to only match renames of global
	commands, not commands in other namespaces that happen to mask
	global commands.

2000-10-04  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/nub.test: 
	* nub.tcl: 
	* initdebug.tcl: Added debugger_setCatchFlag to allow scripts to
	override the normal error suppressing behavior of the "catch"
	wrapper.  If the catch flag is set to 1, then the debugger will
	break on errors even if they would normally be masked by an
	enclosing catch statement. [Bug: 6252]

2000-07-28  Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* coverage.tcl:
	 Switched to use images/win_cover.gif instead of base64-inlined image.

2000-07-25  Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* pkgIndex.tcl - no need to source the system.tcl
	(or system.tbc) file explicitly.

2000-07-22  Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Changed pkgIndex.tcl file to source directly the
	debugger.tcl and system.tcl files so that the
	system:: api calls work during early dialogs.

2000-06-30  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/dbgLaunch.tcl: Made the executable name settable with an
	arg to testDbg.

	* tests/nub.test: 
	* nub.tcl: Changed DbgNub_GetVar to avoid triggering array traces
	when fetching an array element.  This won't work in all cases
	because of upvar aliases, but it should handle the typical
	scenario. [Bug: 4095]

2000-06-26  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* portWin.tcl: Added "Cancel" button to socket error dialog.
	[Bug: 3164] 

	* block.tcl: Lint.

	* tests/nub.test: 
	* nub.tcl: Fixed DbgNub_GetVar to check for Windows bug where null
	env entries are implicitly unset even though they appear in the
	array names list. [Bug: 4120]

	* tests/blend.test: 
	* blend.pdx: Fixed blend instrumentation that interfered with the
	Tk bind command. [Bug: 5429]

2000-06-14  Scott Stanton  <stanton@ajubasolutions.com>

	* menu.tcl: Fixed duplicate accelerator key. [Bug: 3857]

2000-05-15  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* proj.tcl: Fixed improper computation of project base name that
	resulted in clipping the "untitled" project name.

	* gui.tcl: Changed the user break dialog to use tk_messageBox
	instead of tk_dialog in order to get better look and feel and to
	get proper transient behavior.  It now appears above the main
	dialog window in the stacking order.  Changed to deiconify
	debugger when hitting a breakpoint or when the application
	exits. [Bug: 488]

	* menu.tcl: Restart menu item is not properly disabled for remote
	projects. [Bug: 5377]

2000-05-09  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl: Avoid calling "file nativename" on http URLs.

	* menu.tcl: Fixed problems with quoting of help file names.
	[Bug: 3937] 

2000-05-04  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* procWin.tcl: Fixed bug 3244, where the first item in the textbox
	would get auto-selected along with the already-selected item after
	hitting Instrument/Uninstrument.  Sometime within the past month,
	someone also fixed a bug where the Instrument and Uninstrument
	buttons could be enabled or disabled simultaneously.
	
2000-04-12  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

	* block.tcl: added code to initialize which ranges can be covered
	after a new block is instrumented.

	* codeWin.tcl: added code to update which ranges are highlighted
	at a breakpoint.

	* dbg.tcl: added code to tell the nub to start storing coverage if
	coverage is enabled.

	* debugger.tcl.in: added -coverage flag to turn on the code
	coverage feature.  Now sources the new coverage.tcl and
	pre-existing tcltest.pdx files.

	* gui.tcl: added code to initialize the coverage gui and update it
	whenever the debugger stops.

	* nub.tcl: added code to store the current location in DbgNub
	array whenever DbgNub_Do is called if coverage is turned on.  (it
	is off by default).

	* Makefile.in: added coverage.tcl and tcltest.pdx files.

2000-04-11  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* projWin.tcl: The glob lists were being reversed before items
	were removed.  This resulted in the wrong item being
	deleted. [Bug: 5010]

2000-03-21  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

	* debugger.tcl.in:
	* scwizards.pdx: removed this file and all references to it.
	Scwizards is nolonger an external API.

2000-03-11    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* images/refresh_d.gif: 
	* images/refresh.gif: Fixed so these images properly set their
	transparency color.

	* nub.tcl: Fixed code that called "info" command without proper
	namespace qualifier.

	* system.tcl: 
	* debugger.tcl.in: Added "package require registry" so code will
	work on Windows in a normal Tcl shell.

2000-01-07  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* proj.tcl: Fixed bug 1227, where invalid ports were accepted in
	the Default Project Settings window.

	* portWin.tcl: Fixed bug where low port numbers (which are
	reserved by the OS) would cause a stack trace.  Also fixed a typo
	in the "Error Opening Port" dialog box.

	* menu.tcl: Fixed bug 1617, where the "Show Code" button in the
	Window-Windows window was enabled even when there were no files in
	the list.

2000-01-06  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl: Fixed the "invalid color" error (bugs 2656 & 3581),
	which was caused by some miscalculations in
	system::setWidgetAttributes.

1999-12-23  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl:  Fixed bug 3936 by calling ::start with
	[file nativename $url] rather than just the $url.

	* menu.tcl:  Fixed bug 3937 by listifying the url argument
	when creating the menu item openURL callback scripts.

1999-11-29  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@nutella.scriptics.com>

	* instrument.tcl: added code to store "coverable" ranges in
	instrument::ranges.

	* block.tcl: added blk::getRanges proc to recover "coverable"
	ranges.  Changed blk::isInstrumented to catch the error and return
	0 if the block is empty.

	* dbg.tcl
	* nub.tcl: added nub procedures to store coverage.  Added a
	coverage item to the message sent on break.

	* codeWin.tcl: remove code that ignores invalid breakpoints
	because we nolonger have invalid breakpoints (RFE 99).

	* dbg.tcl: added validateBreakpoints, binarySearch, and
	moveLineBreakpoint procedures to move invalid breakpoints to the
	nearest valid line.  Added call to validateBreakpoints if
	dbg::Instrument (RFE 99).

	* prefWin.tcl:
	* system.tcl: changed "Browser" pref tab to "Other" and added
	WarnInvalidBp pref to that tab.  The new global pref has a default
	value of 1.  changed system::getInterps to use the
	projectInfo::executable array for the names of tclsh and wish
	files.

	* menu.tcl:
	* gui.tcl: changed to enable refreshButton when current block is
	not instrumented, even if that state is stopped or running.
	
1999-11-28  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@nutella.scriptics.com>

	* codeWin.tcl: fixed bug 3623 by removing the last newline in the
	codebar when uninstrumented code is displayed.

	* debugger.tcl.in: removed nologo option from debugger.  Updated
	pdx file locator to use projectInfo variables.

1999-11-22  Melissa Chawla  <hershey@nutella.scriptics.com>

	* gui.tcl: reevaluate state for refreshFile button whenever
	gui::changeState or gui::updateStatusFile is called.  Fixed bug
	3631 by adding "kill" to the list of buttons to enable when the
	debugger state is changed to "stopped".

	* image.tcl
	* toolbar.tcl
	* system.tcl
	* bindings.tcl: added bindings, images, toolbar buttons, menu
	items, and invoakation callback procs for new refreshFile
	feature. (RFE 3255).

1999-11-18  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* projWin.tcl: Fixed Project Preferences window (bug 2442) -- you
	can now select elements in the textbox by clicking in the white
	space next to them.  The solution is to insert items in the text
	boxes, followed by "\n".

1999-11-17  Sandeep Tamhankar  <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* procWin.tcl: I fixed bug #3244, where the procedure window's
	buttons were doing erratic things once a pattern was entered.  The
	problem was inconsistent record-keeping with respect to which item
	was currently selected.  Now, whenever a pattern is entered, the
	first item in the list is automatically (and consistently) selected.

1999-11-15  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl
	* menu.tcl: Fixed Tcl/Tk help menu (bug 3562)--now the installer
	and tools agree on where to find the help file.  Added projectInfo
	namespace variables to point to Tcl/Tk and Connect help.

1999-11-15  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: Procedures that are deleted while still on the stack
	were generating errors in DbgNub_PushStack because "namespace
	origin" generates an error instead of returning an empty string
	like "info commands". So now the nub checks for existence with
	"info commands" before attempting to resolve the procedure
	name. [Bug: 3613]

1999-11-12  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* uplevel.pdx
	* debugger.tcl.in: Added sourcing of uplevel.pdx: fixed bug 477.

	* debugger.tcl.in: Removed sourcing of scwizards.pdx.  This should
	not be added until the scwizards.pdx file is brought up to date:
	entered bug 3592.

1999-11-11  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* bindings.tcl:
	* system.tcl:
	* menu.tcl: Fixed bug 3562.  Changed Debugger help to use html
	help at Scriptics' web site.  Removed Tcl/Tk help from debugger
	on Unix.

1999-11-09  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* proj.tcl: Fixed bug 2449: preserved the breakpoints before
	updating project info from a saved project file, and then restored
	the existing line breakpoints.

1999-11-08  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* proj.tcl: Fixed bug 2702 by wrapping a call to
	projWin::CancelProjectSettings inside a call to projWin::isOpen.

1999-11-05  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* initdebug.tcl: Added sentinel to avoid redefining debugger_*
	procedures if they are already defined.  This will fix the
	problems that occur if initdebug.tcl is sourced after
	debugger_init has successfully connected to a debugger.
	[Bug: 3481]

	* debugger.tcl.in: Changed to handle case where .about window is
	destroyed before the <Destroy> binding can be established.
	[Bug: 3285]

1999-11-02  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: On Linux, the socket may return an error instead of EOF
	on the read side when the debugger disconnects from the nub.  So,
	now we catch this case and clean up.

1999-11-01  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: DbgNub_SendMessage did not handle the case where the
	"flush" fails due to the socket detecting a closed remote pipe.
	DbgNub_Instrument did not handle failures while waiting for the
	instrumented code.  It failed to reset the DbgNub(iscript) value
	before waiting for the reply so it didn't detect a lost
	connection properly and ended up returning old code from the
	previous instrumented block.  [Bug: 3252]
	
	* nub.tcl: DbgNub_GetVar incorrectly truncated trailing whitespace
	when fetching values with a maximum length specified. [Bug: 3260]

1999-11-01  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* tclCom.pdx:  updated foreachitem table entry to accept either 3
	or 4 arguments, where the last args is always a script.

1999-10-22  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: Changed nub variable truncation code to copy variable
	before truncation to avoid losing the internal rep.  This is
	important for extensions like TclBlend where the internal rep is
	precious.  Also fixed an off by one error in the maxlen computation.

1999-10-21  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* debugger.tcl.in: Added description for -display argument.
	[Bug: 3125] 

	* gui.tcl: Changed to use aboutCmd parameter to display about box
	so we can customize the about for each product.

1999-10-20  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* inspectorWin.tcl: fixed bug 2703 that cause data display window
	to appear empty if opened twice on the same variable.

	* blend.pdx: fixed bug in the way the java::try command was
	getting instrumented.

	* instrument.tcl: fixed bug in parseSimpleArgs that caused
	controll structures with max numArgs = -1 not to get
	instrumented.

1999-10-19  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* tclCom.pdx: added support for the new tclcom::foreachitem
	command.

1999-10-19  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/guiLaunch.tcl: 
	* tests/dbgLaunch.tcl: Updated test files to reflect recent changes.
	
	* system.tcl: 
	* proj.tcl: 
	* menu.tcl: 
	* gui.tcl: 
	* debugger.tcl.in: Changed debugger::init to take application
	specific parameters and store in a debugger::parameters array.
	This centralizes the parameter setting and makes it easier to
	document and maintain.  Made the default project type a settable
	parameter.  [Bug: 3040]
	
	* system.tcl: 
	* gui.tcl: 
	* debugger.tcl.in: Changed to use Winico to set the window icon to
	::projectInfo::iconImage. [Bug: 3108]	 

1999-10-18  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* gui.tcl: 
	* debugger.tcl.in: Changed startup to display about box before
	displaying the main window. Unless explicitly dismissed, the about
	box is displayed for 2.5 seconds.  The debugger continues to
	initialize in the background. [Bug: 3095]
	
	* debugger.tcl.in: Changed startup code to only display banner
	when -help or -version flags are specified. [Bug: 2929]

1999-10-13  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl: Removed stale code. [Bug: 3070]

	* tests/system.test: 
	* tests/protest.tcl: 
	* tests/proj.test: 
	* tests/nub.test: 
	* tests/initProject.tcl: 
	* tests/guiLaunch.tcl: 
	* tests/dbgLaunch.tcl: 
	* tests/all.tcl: 
	* Makefile.in: Lots of test script cleanup to make it work in the
	new build environment.

	* nub.tcl: Fixed initial value to DbgNub(script) to be in list
	form to avoid unwanted substitutions. [Bug: 3093]

1999-10-12  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl: Fixed bug in code that caused preferences to go into
	the wrong directory.

	* debugger.tcl.in: 
	* cmdline.tcl: 
	* Makefile.in: Moved cmdline.tcl into a separate package/module.

1999-10-11  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl: 
	* proj.tcl: 
	* menu.tcl: 
	* gui.tcl: 
	* debugger.tcl.in: Fixed command line parsing to look for -help
	instead of -prohelp.  Replaced references to version with
	references to projectInfo.
	
	* version.tcl.in: 
	* configure.in: 
	* Makefile.in: Changed so .tbc files are only generated for
	release builds.  Changed to use projectInfo library instead of
	private copy of version.tcl.

1999-09-10  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: Fixed additional mismatch in stack frames due to
	partially resolved procedure names.

1999-09-07  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* prodebug.tcl: 
	* nub.tcl: added debugger_attached API to make it possible to
	check to see if the debugger is currently attached to the process.

	* nub.tcl: Fixed bug where procedure frames that correspond to
	indirectly resolved namespace names would appear as deleted
	frames. [Bug: 2697]

	* nub.tcl: Changed debugger_eval so it appears on the stack as a
	separate frame to fix a problem where calls to debugger_eval would
	mess up the stack order when called from uninstrumented
	frames. [Bug: 2698]

1999-08-12  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* proj.tcl: fixed bug (2536) that caused a stack trace when new
	projects are opened, canceled, and then closed.  This bus was
	fixed by resetting the projWin::destroyCmd var to empty when the
	proj::closeProjDialog procedure gets the "don't save" event from
	the message box.

1999-08-06  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: fixed bug that caused sourced files not to get
	instrumented after code is autoloaded.  The fix was to reset the
	DbgNub(inAutoLoad) variable to 0 before testing whether to set it
	to 1.

1999-07-31  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: applied Scott S.'s patch to tell the nub that no error
	has been handled.

1999-07-30  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl:
	* projWin.tcl: Further fixing of bug 490.  Empty interp lists for
	preexisting projects and project defaults from prior versions are
	now filled in.

1999-07-26  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl: Fixed bug 490 by finding the protclsh and prowish
	files relative to the prodebug executable.  The Windows
	implementation of this feature nolonger uses the registry to find
	these files.  Windows now uses the same code as the Unix to find
	these interps.

	* gui.tcl: Updated credits to include the entire company.
	
1999-07-23    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl: Changed implementation of debugger_eval to support
	-name switch.  This adds the ability to associate a virtual file
	name with a block of code so breakpoints are persistent.

	* dbg.tcl: Fixed handling of ERROR values on dbg::Send to cleanly
	propagate errors.

1999-07-23  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* find.tcl: Fixed bug 2429 by changing \{$findVar\} to [list
	$findVar].

	* proj.tcl: Fixed bug 2279 by adding a call to
	projWin::CancelProjSettings, which closes the project settings
	window, to proj::closeProjCmd.

1999-07-22  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl:  Fixed bug 2289.  Initialize the DbgNub(script) stack
	with the value of [info script], rather than the empty string.
	The initial value must be set for the remote debugging case, as
	the script is not sourced.  For the local debugging case, the
	initial value is temporarily appLaunch.tcl, which is not correct,
	but this value will never be accessed because the "initial" script
	will be sourced, thereby pushing the correct script name on the
	stack.

1999-07-02  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* projWin.tcl: "*" is added to an empty "instrument these files"
	listbox when either apply or ok is pressed.  Fixed bug where
	glob patterns were being compared using glob style matching
	instead of exact matching.

1999-07-01  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* codeWin.tcl:
	* menu.tcl:
	* gui.tcl: fixed RFE 51 by adding a horizontal scrollbar.  Changed
	elements of code window to use grid rather than pack.  Added
	gui::scrollDbgTextX procedure to display the horizontal scrollbar
	when it is needed.  Added code::moveScrollbarX to move ove the
	elevator of the scrollbar while maintaining the alignment between
	the CodeWin, CodeBar and LineBar.

1999-06-25  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* projWin.tcl: fixed RFE 697 by adding a gui (in the
	"instrumentation" tab of the project window) for specifying which
	files to instrument (in addition to the existing gui for
	specifying which files not to instrument).

	* proj.tcl: added calls to projWin::nonEmptyInstruText to force
	an empty "instruText" window to have a "*" in it when the user
	presses "Apply" or "OK".

	* nub.tcl: The nub proc "DbgNub_sourceWrapper" was modified to
	check files against the value "DbgNub(includeFiles)", the new
	user-entered value retrieved by the nub from the debugger.

	* dbg.tcl: modified to add the new "doInstrument" project
	preference.

	* system.tcl: modified to give DbgNub(includeFiles) the default value
	"*"; by default, all files are instrumented.

1999-06-24  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* inspectorWin.tcl: fixed bug 30 by adding a "close" button to the
	upper-right corner of the Data Display window.  Now all auxilliary
	windows have a close button.

1999-06-18  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* system.tcl: fixed bug 1204.  Instead of "file join .. .. $dir",
	code now calls "file dirname" twice to get the same effect without
	leaving "../../" in the file path.

1999-06-02    <wart@scriptics.com>
	* gui.tcl:
	* licenseWin.tcl:  Fixed bug that was causing the "About" box
	to ping the license server.  License info is now cached.
	[Bug: 1238]

	* system.tcl:  If no preferences are found, the debugger attempts
	to promote preferences from older versions.  If no older preferences
	are found, a default set is created.

1999-05-13    <surles@scriptics.com>

	* gui.tcl: 
	* proj.tcl: 
	* projWin.tcl: Modified the APIs so it would more aggressively
	search for an initial file to display in the code window when
	the initial startup script is set.  Also fixed the problem with
	displaying relative paths.  [Bug: 1222 1254 1313]

	* proj.tcl: 
	* projWin.tcl: Fixed bugs that caused preferences to be applied
	even when Cancel is pressed.  Added another callback command so we
	now have one for "Apply/OK" and one for "Cancel." [Bug: 2026]

	* proj.tcl: Fixed bug that caused multiple project files with
	mixed case to be entered more then once in the "Recently Used"
	list of projects.  This fix was only applied for Windows.  
	[Bug: 1232] 

	* projWin: Added .test file type to the "Open File Dialog" for
	script files.  This is useful because most Tcl test files use this
	extension.

	* projWin: Fixed bug in Label for the list of files not to be
	instrumented.  The previous label "glob Pattern" was misleading
	because it only performed a string comparison between the file
	being sourced and the pattern.  The new label read "String Match
	Pattern."  Additionally, I added a Copy and Paste binding on the
	listbox and entry widget respectively.  This makes editing
	existing entries much easier.  [Bug: 696]

	* toolbar.tcl: Fixed bug that was removing the binding on <Enter>
	and <Leave> for the first two buttons in the Debugger Toolbar.
	This bug was added when we started adding context sensitive
	messages to these buttons based on the state of  Debugger. 
	[Bug: 2019] 
	
1999-05-04    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* nub.tcl:
	* dbg.tcl:
	* prodebug.tcl: Changed socket layer to use "utf-8" encoding when
	communicating with 8.1 and later interpreters and to use the
	"iso8859-1" for 8.0 and earlier interpreters.

1999-02-19    <surles@YODA>

	* menu.tcl: Fixed logic bug that prevented the "Save Project" menu
	entry from ever being enabled.

	* gui.tcl: Made the Connection Status Window transient to the main
	window and attempted to preserve it window geometry.

1999-02-18    <surles@YODA>

	* proj.tcl: Fixed code based on a more rigorous examination of
	what is supposed to happen when Apply is pressed given the various
	GUI states and modes of entering and exiting the Project Settings
	Window. 

	* projWin.tcl: Added "break" at the end of the <Return> and
	<Escape> bindings so they will not filter up.  Without the break,
	if you press Return in the entry box, both the entry box and the
	top level attempt to kill the window.

	* gui.tcl: Fixed bug where the serverPort was not re-initialized
	after a running app is killed by the GUI or by some other,
	external, means.
	
1999-02-17    <surles@YODA>

	* prodebug.tcl
	* system.tcl Changed the default remote port to be 2576
	
	* gui.tcl
	* menu.tcl
	* proj.tcl
	* projWin.tcl Made the Project Settings window less modal.  Now
	the menu items are enabled when the window is being displayed,
	there are less bugs relating to when a project is initialized and
	a more consitent definition of the interactions of a new, current
	and default project setting window. [Bug: 1211]
	
	* gui.tcl
	* portWin.tcl Moved the gui::badPortUI routine into its own module
	due the number of bugs and inflexibility of the code.  In this one
	block of code I found 7 bugs, many of them caused a Tcl stack
	trace.  [Bug: 1219]

1999-02-16    <surles@YODA>

	* toolbar.tcl: 
	* gui.tcl: Added logic that changes the help message for the Run a
	and Step buttons based on the state of the GUI.  

1999-02-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* menu.tcl: Fixed typo in menu invokeCmd.
	
	* gui.tcl: Added global key bindings to .mainDbgWin.

1999-02-09    <surles@YODA>
	* projWin.tcl:
	* prefWin.tcl:
	* system.tcl: Changed the Temp group to be TempPref and TempProj
	so there is no conflict when both windows are opened.

	* find.tcl: Fixed bug that did not focus on the code win when Find
	Next was pressed.  Fixed bug that did not test for valid entries
	in the Goto Window. [Bug 1185] [Bug 1186]

	* gui.tcl:
	* pref.tcl: Created gui wrapper around the dbg::quit command so
	the file caching mechanism is flushed everytime quit is
	requested.  Otherwise a stack trace would occur when a remote
	project is loaded, a file is being viewed in the code win, and the
	project is changed to be a local project.  The quit was called,
	deleting all blocks, but the file remaind in view with a stale
	block reference.

	* projWin.tcl:
	* proj.tcl: Removed vwait commands and now pass the command to
	execute when the Project Settings Window is dismissed.  Now the
	projWin::showWindow command takes a command to execute when the
	window is canceled, versus setting a vwait variable.

	* pref.tcl: Added cleanup in the pref::groupDelete command that
	unset the dirty bit.

	* menu.tcl: Fixed bug that wasn't disabling menu items correctly
	for remote apps.  Step In and Run need to be disabled if the state
	is new and the project is remote.  Restart needs to be disabled if
	the project is remote, or if there is no project loaded.

	* system.tcl: 
	* breakWin.tcl:
	* codeWin.tcl:
	* font.tcl:
	* gui.tcl:
	* licenseWin.tcl:
	* menu.tcl:
	* proj.tcl:
	* projWin.tcl:
	* system.tcl:
	* tabnotebook.tcl:
	* varWin.tcl:
	* watchWin.tcl: Removed the following prefs from the preferences
	system: arrow, bar, color, exeFile, exeString, fontList, and
	projectPath.

1999-02-08    <surles@YODA>

	* menu.tcl: Removed the fileList and prevOpenDir variables from
	the menu namespace since they were no longer being used.

	* system.tcl: 
	* menu.tcl: Removed the dbgHelpFile and tclHelpFile from the user
	preferences.
	
	* menu.tcl: 
	* proj.tcl:
	* gui.tcl: Made relative paths entered for local projects default
	to the same path as the location of the project file. [Bug: 1087]

	* system.tcl: 
	* menu.tcl: 
	* proj.tcl: Moved the previously opened project to the
	GlobalDefault group for consistency.  Previously it was being
	saved in variuos places depending on the state of the GUI and this
	was inconsistent.  Putting it into the the GlobalDefaults group is
	less preferable then making it a Project pref, but simplifies the
	code emensely. 

1999-02-05    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* dbg.tcl: Changed getProcBody to properly substitute the body
	before returning it. [Bug: 347]

1999-02-04    <surles@YODA>
	* watchWin.tcl:
	* proj.tcl: Projects were not preserving watch variables.

	* watchWin.tcl: The watch window wasn't updating correctly.  Now
	when users add vars when the gui is stopped, the window reflects
	this change. [Bug: 1027]
	
	* codeWin.tcl: Put catch around the command that gets the source
	from a block.  If the block is an unreadable file an error is
	generated.  This error is now caught and reported to the
	user. [Bug: 454]

	* breakWin.tcl: 
	* evalWin.tcl: 
	* inspectorWin.tcl: 
	* watchWin.tcl: 
	* menu.tcl: Modified default size of auxillary window to account
	for the addition of the "Close" buttons.

	* system.tcl: Improved the logic about preserving the previously
	loaded project file.  I was still using "file exists" when I
	should have been using the projectNeverSaved bit.

	* startup.tcl (proc): Moved most of the init code out of the
	namespace eval and into its own procedure.  Added an update call
	after the mainDbgWindow is drawn so we do not have focus ars
	beteen it and the "File Missing" window.

	* projWin.tcl: Force the focus to the main window when the Project
	Settings Window is deleted.

	* proj.tcl: Force the focus on the "File Missing Window" and added
	a test in the initPort that does not kill the app if it is running.

1999-02-04    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* dbg.tcl: Changed getProcBody to properly substitute the body
	before returning it. [Bug: 347]


	* find.tcl: Fixed so goto window doesn't generate an error when
	the goto entry is blank.
	
	* breakWin.tcl: 
	* evalWin.tcl: 
	* find.tcl: 
	* gui.tcl: 
	* menu.tcl: 
	* prefWin.tcl:
	* procWin.tcl:
	* projWin.tcl:
	* watchWin.tcl: Added <Escape> binding to all dialogs to invoke the
	cancel/close action.  Ensured that all buttons have the
	appropriate -default setting.

	* menu.tcl: Updated debug menu so logging output works again.

1999-02-05  Bryan Surles  <surles@scriptics>

	* gui.tcl
	* dbg.tcl
	* gui.tcl 
	* menu.tcl
	* proj.tcl
	* projWin.tcl
	* project.tcl
	* startup.tcl
	* system.tcl
	* toolbar.tcl Cleanup of code to get *some* of the modules to 
	adhere to the Tcl coding standards.  Broke out the project file 
	into proj.tcl and projWin.tcl and changed the namespaces from
	prj to proj and projWin where appropriate.


1999-02-02    <surles@YODA>
	* menu.tcl:  
	* pref.tcl:  
	* system.tcl:  
	* startup.tcl:  
	* project.tcl: Fixed bug that did not report errors if the
	preference save or restore command failed. [Bug: 1081] [Bug: 1082]

	* project.tcl: Fixed the file based project APIs so that the open,
	save and close APIs are less atomic.  Separated the gui aspect
	from the actions.
	Fixed bug that did not add newly saved file to the recently used
	project list. [Bug: 1080]
	Fixed bug that referred to new, unsaved, projects as a file when
	it should use the simple "Untitled" name. [Bug: 1083]
	Fixed bug related to remote projects, the project setting window
	and the connection status window [Bug: 1090] [Bug: 1091] [Bug: 1129]

	* pref.tcl: Added comments and implemented Ray's comments from his
	code review.

	* system.tcl: Fixed the close window to save the correct
	information on close.

	* menu.tcl: Updated the menu callbacks for the new(est) file based
	project APIs.

	* gui.tcl: Changed the code::resetWindow algorithm to clear out
	the code window and status window if the block being displayed no
	longer exists.  Puts a catch around the dbg::kill call when there
	was a parse error.  This was beacuse there was a race condition
	and the script may have already died by the time the after event
	fired.  

1999-01-30    <surles@YODA>

	* pref.tcl:  
	* menu.tcl:  
	* project.tcl: Changed the groupGetDirty API to groupIsDirty
	for clarity.

	* pref.tcl: Cleaned up the code and the comments, removed code
	that was never used.

1999-01-29    <surles@YODA>

	* nub.tcl: Fixed minor bug that miscalculated the number of
	characters to return in the DbgNub_GetResult command.

1999-01-28    <surles@YODA>

	* system.tcl: Added cleaner initialization of preferences and
	removed a preference that was not being used (some how projRemote
	was changed to appType...)

	* result.tcl: Added test that checks to see if the result frame
	even exists, before it checks to see if it is mapped.  It
	generated a bg Tcl error so it was never seen, but certain tests
	failed because of it.

	* project.tcl: Fixed bug where the default project settings window
	was not cleaning up prrperly after the window is destroyed.  Also,
	put a break statement in the <Return> binding on the "Add" button
	for the instrumentation window.

1999-01-22    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* licenseWin.tcl: revamped license error dialogs to be more
	context sensitive.

1999-01-21    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* menu.tcl: Added keyboard shortcuts for all menu entries.

	* gui.tcl: Revised about box so it resizes based on text
	contents.  Added Easter egg.

1999-01-20    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* system.tcl: 
	* project.tcl: Eliminated yview from project file to reduce the
	number of times the user has to save the project.

1999-01-19    <stanton@GASPODE>


	* startup.tcl: Fixed bug where LicenseExit can be invoked before
	it is defined.
	
	* project.tcl: 
	* prefWin.tcl: Updated focus rings and added default button
	behavior. 

	* system.tcl: 
	* project.tcl:
	* gui.tcl: Revamped error handling to simplify the interface in
	the preferences and the error dialog.  Stopping behavior is now
	separated from suppress/deliver behavior. [RFE: 123]

	* nub.tcl:
	* dbg.tcl: Replaced catchOverride with errorAction that combines
	all of the error reporting flavors.

	* system.tcl: 
	* bindings.tcl: Fixed so disableKey tag doesn't mask the standard
	Windows system bindings for menu traversal.  Remapped <<Dbg_Kill>>
	so it doesn't mask the Windows standard F10 binding.

1999-01-19    <stanton@GASPODE>
	
	* procWin.tcl: Fixed bug that caused code window to changed when
	an instrumented procedure in a file was uninstrumented.

	* stackWin.tcl: 
	* file.tcl: 
	* dbg.tcl: 
	* block.tcl: Added blk::isDynamic interface.

	* project.tcl: Fixed so breakpoints are restored before displaying
	the current file so line breakpoints show up when a project is
	first opened.

	* image.tcl: Fixed typo that caused var_disable icon to be used
	for break_disable.

	* nub.tcl: Fixed interaction between stop on error and step to
	result that caused step to result to miss the end of a command
	that generated a caught error.

1999-01-16    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* system.tcl:
	* project.tcl:
	* dbg.tcl: Fixed broken preference handling for catchOverride.

	* project.tcl:
	* prefWin.tcl: Fixed bug where global window positions were getting
	lost in some cases.

	* project.tcl: Fixed bug in RemoveSelectedInstru that made it
	impossible to remove items from the list.

	* codeWin.tcl: Fixed misalignment of codebar and code windows.

1999-01-14    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* project.tcl: 
	* menu.tcl: 
	* icon.tcl: 
	* breakWin.tcl: 
	* break.tcl: Moved dirty tests for breakpoint changes into gui
	code to minimize cases where it sets the bit.  Fixed a bad test
	for dirty that kept the "save" menu item from being enabled in
	most cases.

	* result.tcl: Removed debugging statements.

	* system.tcl: 
	* project.tcl: Moved current version number for project files into
	a variable in project.tcl, removed thisVersion from preference file.

	* menu.tcl: Removed menu key bindings from preferences file.

	* watchWin.tcl: 
	* inspectorWin.tcl: 
	* gui.tcl: Cleaned up Data Display window and added support for
	displaying current interpreter result.

	* toolbar.tcl: Added Step to Result icon.

	* system.tcl: Added highlight_cmdresult and showResult global
	prefs.  Fixed broken update scripts for highlight colors.  Fixed
	code that failed to save the last project setting.

	* codeWin.tcl:
	* bindings.tcl:
	* image.tcl:
	* startup.tcl: 
	* result.tcl:
	* menu.tcl: Added support for stepResult and the result window.

	* project.tcl: Added support for saving and restoring line
	breakpoints from the current project.  Changed to save/restore
	current yview instead of the current line.  Changed to clean up
	the entire debugger engine when a project is closed.  This keeps
	breakpoints from bleeding across projects.  Fixed the application
	preferences so they apply properly when the preferences dialog is
	not dismissed.

	* prefWin.tcl: Added preference for command result highlight color.

	* nub.tcl: Added support for post execution breakpoints (e.g. step
	to result) and caching the last result and return code.

	* gui.tcl: Eliminated the currentError flag since the break state
	flag contains the same information. Added an optional window to
	display the current interpreter result. Added support for step to
	result, including a new toolbar button and a different
	highlighting color.  Changed resetWindow so any cached blocks are
	removed.

	* dbg.tcl: Added cmdresult event.  Moved list of valid events into
	namespace variable so it is easier to maintain.  Added
	dbg::getResult to fetch the most recent result and return code
	from the nub.

	* codeWin.tcl: Fixed bug that resulted in breakpoints not being
	displayed in uninstrumented files.

	* break.tcl: changed to mark preferences dirty whenever a line
	breakpoint is added or removed

1999-01-12    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* dbg.tcl: Improved logging interface to allow filtering.

	* block.tcl: Changed to cache sorted line number list right after
	instrumentation.
	* codeWin.tcl: Fixed performance bug in updateCodeBar that was
	using a non-linear algorithm. [Bug: 1032]

1999-01-07    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* instrument.tcl: removed 'case' from table
	fixed lots of bad table entries
	added non exp* commands for expect
	added missing parseSwitches and parseExpTrapCmd implementations

1999-01-06    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* instrument.tcl: Fixed bug in initialization when no extensions
	were being loaded.

	* system.tcl:
	* startup.tcl: Moved kill to system.tcl

	* prefWin.tcl: 
	* nub.tcl:
	* dbg.tcl: Added support for stopping on caught as well as
	uncaught errors.
	
	* gui.tcl: Added declaration for format array.

1998-12-31    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* startup.tcl:
	* prefWin.tcl: Changed incr76 extension name to incrTcl.

	* nub.tcl: cleaned up some stale arguments, merged
	DbgNub_IncrNamespaceEval and DbgNub_NamespaceEval 

	* instrument.tcl: revamped instrumenter APIs to be more table
	driven, added expect support
